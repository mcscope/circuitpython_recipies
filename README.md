# circuitpython_recipies

This contains recipies for my various circuitpython boards, right now just Circuitplayground express. 
These boards have very limited storage so I want to store programs for them here. 

# Pomodoro
I like the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) for productivity, and use it often, however I don't like to have a ticking timer or alarm because it gives me a feeling of rushing or anxiety.  
This recipie makes the circuitplayground into a low-information pomodoro timer that will subtley give you your progress over a 25 minute work period. 
I like non-interrupting passive information, like a slowly pulsing led because it allows you to stay in the flow state. 

This recipe slowly lights up red leds over a 25 minute work period, and then starts to pulse if you stay in that period. 
slide the switch to take a break.
if you're in the break stage, it lights up green leds over a 8 minute period, then pulses.

Push any button and count the chimes to know how many pomodoros you've had so far!

# Pycon 2019 Swag
This is the code that was distributed with the pycon 2019 swag. I saved it because I'm a digital horder. It has some cool features like the touch piano!
